Just another More clone, reads text files with the ability to print an entire screen of text or line-by-line, OR a fancy-pants scroll feature which I made by using events and timers.

Press enter to begin scrolling, press f to increase speed and s to decrease speed. Space advances to the next screenful and stops scrolling.
